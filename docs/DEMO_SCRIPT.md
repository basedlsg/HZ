**Goal**
A 90 to 120 second walkthrough showing the main flow: check-in, capture, analysis, feed, map, and query.

**Setup**
- Use a device with camera permission granted.
- Start on the check-in screen.
- Have a short scene ready to record (or use a printed page with visible text).

**Talk Track**
- "Ombrixa is a mobile-first app that turns short video clips into structured, searchable intelligence."
- "You start by checking in, which confirms intent and location."
- "From there, you capture a short clip. The app extracts frames and runs multi-frame vision analysis."
- "The result is a structured report that appears in the feed with a safety score, detected details, and a map pin."
- "You can also search across past records locally by plates, badges, or text."

**Step-by-Step**
1. Hold to check in and mention location gating.
2. Record a short clip and point out the 30 second limit.
3. Show the analysis state, then the generated event card.
4. Open the intel overlay to show structured fields.
5. Switch to the map view to show the incident marker.
6. Open the query portal and search for a keyword from the report.

**Shot List**
- Check-in screen with hold-to-verify ring.
- Camera UI with record button and timer.
- Analysis loader screen.
- Feed card with summary and safety score.
- Intel overlay with editable structured details.
- Map view with incident marker.
- Query portal with a successful search result.

**Fallbacks**
- If analysis is slow, mention it is running and cut to the feed result.
- If camera fails, show an existing feed item and focus on the intelligence layer.
