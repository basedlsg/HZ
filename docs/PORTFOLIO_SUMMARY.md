**Title**
Ombrixa - Mobile AI for situational awareness

**One-line**
A mobile-first PWA that turns short video clips into structured, searchable intelligence using multi-frame vision AI.

**Problem**
People can record moments, but cannot quickly extract actionable details from them in the field.

**Solution**
Ombrixa gates capture with a quick check-in, samples frames from short clips, and uses vision AI to produce a structured report. Results appear instantly in a feed and map view, and are searchable on-device.

**Highlights**
- Short capture flow with hold-to-check-in to confirm intent and location.
- Multi-frame analysis with structured JSON output for vehicles, uniforms, and safety scoring.
- Local-first storage using IndexedDB to keep data on device.
- Map view and query portal for fast retrieval of past events.
